          <p>
            In "Countdown" you control 'P' among 70 numbers. Your mission is to
            push and strategically maneuver these numbers, earning points by
            smashing them against walls. But beware, within this dynamic
            labyrinth, zeros roam unpredictably, threatening 'P'. An encounter
            with these zeroes will cost 'P' a life.
