          <p>
            In "Countdown" you control 'P' among 70 numbers. Your mission is to
            push and strategically maneuver these numbers, earning points by
            smashing them against walls. But beware, within this dynamic
            labyrinth, zeros roam unpredictably, threatening 'P'. An encounter
            with these zeroes will cost 'P' a life.

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <h4>Basic Game Rules</h4>
        <p>--> Displayed time unit in the game is approximately 1 second</p>
        <p>
          --> If number 0 and 'P' encounters on the same square 'P' loses a life
        </p>
        <p>--> If 'P' loses all 5 of it's lives the game is over</p>
        <p>
          --> 'P' can push non-increasing number sequences, if there is an empty
          square behind the number
        </p>
        <h4>Pushing/Smashing Rules</h4>
        <p>
          --> If there is a wall behind the last number 'P' can smash the last
          number when pushing non-increasing number sequences. P cannot smash
          the number in the neighboring square. Non-pushable sequences are also
          non-smashable.
        </p>
        <p>
          --> For each smashed number, a new random number (5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 with
          equal probability) is generated in a random place.
